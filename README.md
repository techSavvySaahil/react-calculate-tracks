This app is created with React JS.
This is my first project in React JS.
So, please let me know if you think there could be improvements.

## Deployed app available at:
https://techsavvysaahil.github.io/react-calculate-tracks/

You can calculate the number of tracks required for a station.

## Steps to be followed:
1. Make new trains by dragging and dropping components into the drop area.
2. Components can also be dragged and dropped onto the trains built.
3. Make sure each built train has exactly one locomotive and at least one carriage.
4. The maximum number of locomotive, a train can have, is 2.
5. Otherwise, the arrival and departure timing input boxes would be disabled.
6. User needs to fill arrival and departure timings for all the trains built.
7. Input format for the timings is eg. 9.15, 10.20, 13.40, 16.10 etc.
8. Clicking on **Calculate tracks** would give the maximun number of tracks required for that sation according to the arrival and departure timings of the trains built.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
